## File Descriptions
There are only 2 filer in this repository (except the README and requirements file).
- Proyek_Final_Data_Science.ipynb is jupyter notebook it contains clustering the countries using K-Means.
- Data_Negara_HELP.csv is the dataset used

To run this project, you can download this repository and upload in Google Colab  or your code editor. 

## Model Descriptions
The model we use is K-Means from Sklearn cluster. Using the elbow method to determine the number of clusters that have good insertion. The K value that is obtained will do clustering by calculating the silhouette value.
